# Legion Remix Helper

### The Ultimate Quality-of-Life Suite for Legion Remix

Welcome! From the creator of the highly successful **"Remix Gem Helper"** for Mists of Pandaria Remix comes a brand new, all-in-one toolkit designed to eliminate the chores and let you focus on the fun. Legion Remix Helper is an efficiency engine built to automate the most tedious parts of the event, manage your inventory, and guide you to every single collectible.

Spend less time managing, and more time playing!

## Key Features

### ► Automated Inventory Management

Say goodbye to cluttered bags and endless clicking. This addon is designed to keep your inventory clean with powerful automation.

* **Advanced Auto-Scrapping:** A dedicated UI next to the scrapping machine where you can set your own rules (e.g., "ignore epics," "only scrap downgrades"). Once set, just check the "Auto Scrap" box, and the addon will automatically fill the slots for you. All you have to do is spam the "Scrap" button to clear out your bags in seconds!

* **Quick Action Bar:** A customizable bar for all your Remix-specific items. Its star feature is a single, smart **"Open Next Cache"** button. Just click it repeatedly to open all the chests and caches in your bags without ever having to search for them. You can also add other items like the Dalaran Hearthstone and fully customize the bar's layout to save space on your main action bars.

### ► The Ultimate Collector's Companion

For every player who wants to collect all the limited-time mounts, transmogs, and toys, this is your new best friend.

* **Complete Collections Tab:** A beautiful, dedicated UI, designed like the in-game Toy Journal, that lists **every single reward** available in the event.

* **Detailed Source Information:** The tab tells you exactly where each item comes from (vendor, achievement, etc.) and how much it costs if it's from a vendor.

* **Instant Vendor Waypoints:** This is a game-changer. Simply **Alt-Click** any vendor item in the list to instantly get a map waypoint directing you straight to the correct NPC. No more looking up coordinates on Wowhead!

### ► Effortless Power & Leveling

Streamline your character's progression and ensure you're always at your strongest.

* **Auto-Talent Purchasing:** Automatically buys your Artifact Talents for you whenever you switch specializations.

* **Smart Notifications:** Get a clear, on-screen alert when you have a potential gear upgrade sitting in your bags, so you never miss a power increase.

* **Auto Questing:** Includes a simple "Auto-Accept" and "Auto-Turn-in" feature for quests to make leveling faster.

### A Personal Note from the Developer

The development of this addon was unfortunately slowed down by a personal emergency. My cat, Leo, required a sudden and expensive life-saving surgery.

Thanks to the incredible support from family, friends, and the WoW community, Leo is now home and recovering well! However, we are still working to cover the loans taken for his treatment.

If you enjoy using **Legion Remix Helper** and feel like supporting my work and helping with these vet bills, any donation would be immensely appreciated.

Thank you for your incredible support. I hope this addon makes your Legion Remix experience a fantastic one!
